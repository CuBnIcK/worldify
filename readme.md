# Worldify

This is the plugin for Bukkit 1.7.10-R0.1

It allows every player to have their personal world, where they can do whatever they want.

Plugin is in ultimate-early-development state, so only not much is avaliable.

`/myworld` Teleports player to his personal world, creates world if not exists. World are named world_<playerName>
Warn: It runs in the same thread which server does, so when world is generating it freezes the whole game.

Permissions are: 

* worldify.basic
